# Azure Devops Labs
## Introduction 
Within these labs you will explore Azure Devops and learn the basics of the most important features used: classic view vs yaml file, CI/CD, production/development environments and container steps. You will do this by:
-	Exploring the difference between classic view and yaml files.
-	Developing a simple CI/CD pipeline to build and push an image to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and deploy it to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
-	Add additional script steps and tasks.
-	Use AKS namespaces to build different environments for productions and development.
-	Use pull request to deploy into the production environment.
-	Add a containerized step.
-	Add flake8 as a python linter in the CI/CD pipeline.
-	Add additional tests and features to the app provided.

## Getting Started
Before you can start building, you need an AKS cluster, an ACR and a Devops project. Follow the steps in the included guide `Azure_Devops_Labs.docx`.
